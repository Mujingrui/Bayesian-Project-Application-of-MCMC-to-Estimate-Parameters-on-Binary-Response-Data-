Objectives:
1)Using Bayesian Probit Model with different priors on ùõΩùõΩ and Bayesian Logit Model to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters of interest. In Chapter2, I use these two different models to predict responses with new dataset X. For predicting responses, I also use Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.  
2) For testing the prediction accuracy of Bayesian models, ROC curve is used to compare Bayesian Models with SVC Model in Chapter3.  
3) In Chapter4, for promoting models to get a more accurate result, I use Bayes Factors to exclude two unimportant predictors.  
4) In Chapter5, I am interested the relationship between glu and probability of having diabetes, BMI and chance of having DMII, and the relation of age and having diabetes, so I discuss them based on previous Bayesian Probit Model, which has a better performance. With these discussions, I draw some conclusions about how to keep away from diabetes.
